Adjust the structure based on your specific needs.

## Writing Tests
Write your tests in the `src/test/java` directory. Utilize the Page Object Model (POM) for better maintainability and reusability.

```bash
public class LoginTest {
    @Test
    public void loginTest() {
        LoginPage loginPage = new LoginPage(driver);
        loginPage.navigate();
        loginPage.login("username", "password");
        // Add assertions or further actions as needed
    }
} 
```

Executing Tests
Execute your tests using Maven. For example, to run all tests, use the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```
