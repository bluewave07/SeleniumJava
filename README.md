# Selenium with Java Test Automation Framework

Welcome to the Selenium with Java Test Automation Framework repository! This framework provides a foundation for building robust and scalable automated tests using Selenium WebDriver and Java.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Maven

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

## Project Structure
The project follows a standard Maven project structure:

|-- src
| |-- main
| | |-- java
| | | |-- com.example
| | | | |-- pages
| | | | |-- tests
| |-- test
| | |-- java
| | | |-- com.example
| | | | |-- tests
|-- resources
| |-- drivers
| | |-- chromedriver.exe
| | |-- geckodriver.exe
|-- .gitignore
|-- pom.xml
|-- README.md


Adjust the structure based on your specific needs.

## Writing Tests
Write your tests in the `src/test/java` directory. Utilize the Page Object Model (POM) for better maintainability and reusability.

java
    ```bash
//Example Test
public class LoginTest {
    @Test
    public void loginTest() {
        LoginPage loginPage = new LoginPage(driver);
        loginPage.navigate();
        loginPage.login("username", "password");
        // Add assertions or further actions as needed
    }
}```

Executing Tests
Execute your tests using Maven. For example, to run all tests, use the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```
